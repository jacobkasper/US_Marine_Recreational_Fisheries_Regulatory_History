# US_Marine_Recreational_Fisheries_Regulatory_History
A partial history of US marine recreational fisheries, focus on Atlantic and Gulf coasts

This is the regulatory dataset used in Jacob Kasper's dissertation at the University of Connecticut.
Regulatory histories for marine recreational fisheries in the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico US states starting in the early to mid-1990s are included. 
In the "Regs by state" directory, the original (when available) regulatory documents are provided. 
In "regs by species" there is a directory for each species and the tabulated regulatory history used for the study. Additionally, species-specific documents are also stored in this directory.
Please feel free to contact me if you have additional contributions.
As much as possible this will be updated annually.
